\description{
Constructs a new multiverse object which enables conducting a multiverse analysis
}
\details{
To perform a multiverse analysis, the user needs to first constructs a new multiverse object. The user can declare
multiple analysis pathways within this multiverse object, and execute these analyses. The multiverse object
contains the following slots:
\itemize{
  \item code: This slot stores the user's code for conducting a multiverse analysis. The user can
  define multiple analysis pathways at each step in the analysis using the `branch` call. It supports tidyverse syntax.

  \item parameters: This slot contains a named list of lists. It contains each parameter defined in the
  code using the `branch()` function, and the options defined for each parameter (as a list).

  \item conditions: This slot contain a list of conditions: if any of the
  parameter values are conditional on a specific value of another parameter, these can be defined in the code
  using `branch_assert()` or `branch_exclude()`.

  \item current_parameter_assignment: This slot is a list which contains a single option
  assigned for each parameter defined in the `code`.

  \item multiverse_table: This slot contains a table (in implementation, a tibble which is a
  rectangular data structure) where each column of the table will be a unique parameter.
  The table will contains every possible combination of options for each parameter â€” the number of rows
  corresponds to the number of different analysis paths. The table also contains, for each row, a list of
  option assignments for each parameter (`parameter_assignment` column), code for executing that particular
  analysis (of type `expression`), and environments where each code will be executed.
