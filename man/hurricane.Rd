\description{
A dataset for the study conducted by Jung et al. (2014)
in their study, \emph{Female hurricanes are deadlier than male hurricanes}.
}
\details{
This dataset was collated by Jung et. al in their study \emph{Female hurricanes are deadlier than male hurricanes}
They hypothesised that hurricanes with more feminine names might be perceived as less dangerous and hence lead to 
people taking fewer precautionary measures, resulting in more death and damages.
