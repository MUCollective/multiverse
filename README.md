# Multiverse: An R package for creating multiverse analysis

`multiverse` is an R package that allows users to specify multiverse of
statistical analysis, also called a multiverse analysis. In a multiverse
analysis, researchers identify sets of defensible analysis choices
(e.g., different ways of excluding outliers, different data
transformations), implement them all, and then report the outcomes of
all analyses resulting from all possible choice combinations. However,
declaring several alternative analysis paths can be tricky, often
requiring custom control flows such as nested for-loops and multiple
if-else statements. The **goal** of `multiverse` is to allow users to
create multiverse analyses in a concise and easily interpretable manner.
`multiverse` enables this by providing both an embedded Domain-Specific
Language (DSL) as well as an API to interact with and extract results
from a multiverse analysis, which can then be neatly wrapped within a
larger analysis in R.

Steegen et al. first put forth the concept of [multiverse
analysis](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1745691616658637);
Simonsohn et al. put forth a similar notion called the [Specification
curve
analysis](https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1314&context=marketing_papers).

In a `multiverse` analysis, alternate analysis paths can arise from
having points in the analysis where an analyst has to make a decision of
choosing between two or more reasonable steps. We refer to these
decision points as **parameters**, and they could be:

-   **Data substitution parameters** offer to switch between different
    raw datasets, either collected or simulated.

-   **Data processing parameters** offer to process the same raw data in
    different ways before it is analysed.

-   **Modeling parameters** offer different ways of analysing the same
    processed data

-   **Presentation parameters** offer different ways of presenting
    analysis outcomes

The `multiverse` documentation predominantly follows the tidyverse
syntax

## Installation

You can install the latest development version from GitHub with these R
commands:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mucollective/multiverse")
```

## Overview

For details on how to quickly get started with this package, please
refer to this document as well as the following vignettes:

-   How `multiverse` can be used in different environments such as in
    RScripts and RMarkdown. See `vignette("multiverse-in-rmd")`.
-   How alternate analysis paths can be declared in `multiverse` using
    branch. See `vignette("branch")`.
-   How conditions can be declared in `multiverse` using conditions;
    conditions can be used to state when two steps in a multiverse are
    incompatible with one another. See `vignette("conditions")`.
-   How multiverse results can be extracted and visualised. . See
    `vignette("visualising-multiverse")`.

We also implement a series of end-to-end multiverse implementations
using this package to demonstrate how it might be used (which can be
found in the
[vignettes](https://mucollective.github.io/multiverse/articles/)):

## Example analysis

In this document, we outline an initial approach to conducting a
multiverse analysis in R. We will show how our package can be used to
perform the multiverse analysis outlined by Steegen et al. in
[Increasing Transparency Through a Multiverse
Analysis](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1745691616658637).

Data analysis can involve several decisions involving two or more
options. In most statistical analysis, these decisions are taken by the
researcher based on some reasonable justification. However, for several
decisions, there can be more than one reasonable options to choose from.
A multiverse analysis is a form of analysis which makes all such
decisions explicit and conducts the complete analysis for all
combinations of options (of each decision).

Below, we first illustrate an example of a single analysis for a
dataset. We will then extend it to a multiverse analysis.

## The data

The first step is to read the raw data from the file and store it as a
tibble. We will be following the **tidy data** format here. The data is
provided with the package and can be loaded using the `data("durante)`
command. In this example, we will use the data collected by *Durante et
al.*, which investigated the effect of fertility on religiosity and
political attitudes. We will focus on their second study (which we store
in `df_durante`).

``` r
data("durante")

df_durante <- durante
```

The data look like this:

``` r
df_durante %>%
  head()
```

The original paper looked at the relationship between fertility,
relationship status, and religiosity. But there are many reasonable ways
to have defined each of these three variables from this dataset, so it
is a good candidate for multiverse analysis.

## A single data set analysis: one possible analysis among many

The data collected needs to be processed before it can be modeled.
Preparing the data set for analysis can involve several steps and
decisions regarding how to encode the different raw values. The
following is one example of data processing that can be performed for
this study, where the original authors of the study compute, for each
participant in their study, the typical duration of their menstrual
cycle (`ComputedCycleNext`), the likely date of the next onset of their
menstrual cycle (`NextMenstrualOnset`), the day of the cycle that they
were in when taking the questionnaire (`CycleDay`); they also codify
participants’ relationship status into a binary value (`Relationship`),
and remove data which they believe might have been not captured
accurately such as if the calculation of the length of menstrual cycle
is either too short or too long
(`ComputedCycleLength > 25 & ComputedCycleLength < 35`), or if the
participants were quite unsure of their responses
(`Sure1 <= 5 & Sure2 <= 5`).

``` r
one_universe = df_durante %>%
  mutate( ComputedCycleLength = StartDateofLastPeriod - StartDateofPeriodBeforeLast ) %>%
  mutate( NextMenstrualOnset = StartDateofLastPeriod + ComputedCycleLength ) %>%
  mutate(
    CycleDay = 28 - (NextMenstrualOnset - DateTesting),
    CycleDay = ifelse(CycleDay > 1 & CycleDay < 28, CycleDay, ifelse(CycleDay < 1, 1, 28))
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    RelationshipStatus = factor(ifelse(Relationship==1 | Relationship==2, "Single", "Relationship"))
  ) %>%
  filter( ComputedCycleLength > 25 & ComputedCycleLength < 35) %>%
  filter( Sure1 > 6 | Sure2 > 6 ) %>%
  mutate( Fertility = factor( ifelse(CycleDay >= 7 & CycleDay <= 14, "high", ifelse(CycleDay >= 17 & CycleDay <= 25, "low", "medium")) ) )
```

The transformed data for this one universe looks like this:

``` r
one_universe %>%
  select( NextMenstrualOnset, Relationship, Sure1, Sure2, Fertility, everything() ) %>%
  head()
```

```

However, there also exists other valid processing options: instead of
calculating
`NextMenstrualOnset = StartDateofLastPeriod + ComputedCycleLength`, it
can also be calculated as `StartDateofLastPeriod + ReportedCycleLength`.
Such alternate processing options can exist for several decisions that a
researcher makes in the data processing, analysis and presentation
stages. This can thus result in a *multiverse of analysis*, with the one
described above representing a single *universe*.

How would one declare such different alternate ways of calculation
easily and efficiently? Below, we describe how our package allows you to
make such declarations with ease.

## Multiverse specification

`multiverse` provides flexible functions which can be used to easily
multiplex over alternative analysis steps, and perform a multiverse
analysis.

The first step is to define a *new multiverse*. We will use the
multiverse object to create a set of universes, each representing a
different way of analysing our data.

``` r
M <- multiverse()
```

### Two ways to building a multiverse

The `multiverse` enables the users to declare alternative analysis using
a embedded DSL, the syntax for which closely resembles R and tidyverse
syntax. However, this DSL cannot be executed directly in R and needs to
be declared, processed and executed in a special environment. To be more
precise, `multiverse` takes the user declared code in the DSL form,
parses the abstract syntax tree, and rewrites the code into multiple
versions of valid R code corresponding to each universe in the
multiverse.

To get around these limitations, we declare this code “inside the
multiverse object”. In the `multiverse` package, we support this
declaration in two ways:

-   using *multiverse code chunks*, which allow users to declare
    multiverse code in a dedicated code chunk, and is more consistent
    with the interactive programming interface of RStudio.
-   using the `inside()` function. The inside function which allows
    users to declare multiverse code in RScripts or regular R code
    blocks, and is more suited for a script-style implementation.

**Note** that the `inside` function is more suited for a script-style
implementation. Keeping consistency with the interactive programming
interface of RStudio, we also offer the user a `multiverse code block`
which can be used instead of the `r` code block to write code inside a
multiverse object (see for more details on using the multiverse with
RMarkdown).

#### Multiverse code blocks

We can use the [*multiverse code
blocks*](https://mucollective.github.io/multiverse/articles/multiverse-in-rmd.html)
instead of the regular `r` code block to write code inside a multiverse
object (see for more details on using the multiverse code blocks with
RMarkdown). This allows you to write more concise code and is more
consistent with the interactive programming interface of RStudio. A
*multiverse code block* is a custom engine designed to work with the
`multiverse` package, to implement the multiverse analyses. Below we
show how code can be implemented using the *multiverse code block*

    ```{multiverse default-m-1, inside = M}
    # here we just create the variable `df` in the multiverse
    df <- df_durante

    # here, we perform two `mutate` operations in the multiverse.
    # although they could have been chained, this illustrates 
    # how multiple variables can be declared together using the `{}`
    df <- df_durante %>%
      mutate( ComputedCycleLength = StartDateofLastPeriod - StartDateofPeriodBeforeLast ) %>%
      mutate( NextMenstrualOnset = branch(menstrual_calculation, 
        "mc_option1" ~ StartDateofLastPeriod + ComputedCycleLength,
        "mc_option2" ~ StartDateofLastPeriod + ReportedCycleLength,
        "mc_option3" ~ StartDateNext)
      )
    ```

The code within the second `mutate` function call is written in the
`multiverse` DSL and cannot be executed directly in R. For now, ignore
what the `branch` function does as we will discuss about this in more
detail in the next section

We provide the ability to declare multiverse code block as an *Addin* in
RStudio. Users can click on *Addins* toolbar menu in RStudio (see the
image below). This would create a multiverse code block at the location
of the cursor in the document.

<img src="vignettes/multiverse-addins.png" width="90%" />

Alternately, users can insert a multiverse code block using a keyboard
shortcut. Users can create a keyboard shortcut to declare a multiverse
code block inside a RMarkdown document through the following steps:

-   Tools &gt; Addins &gt; Browse Addins… &gt; Keyboard Shortcuts
-   Next, in the filter input field, type *multiverse*. You will see one
    result with “Insert multiverse code chunk” as the name.
-   Click on the Shortcut field and press Cmd+Option+M (on Mac OS) or
    Ctrl+Shift+Alt+M (on Windows).
-   Click “Apply” and exit the dialog box

Please refer to for more details on using the multiverse code blocks
with RMarkdown.

#### `inside()`

Alternatively, we can use regular `r` code blocks instead of the regular
to write code inside a multiverse object The `inside()` function takes
in two arguments: 1. the multiverse object, M; and 2. the code for the
analysis (including branches). Note that if you are passing multiple
expressions, they should be enclosed within `{}`.

Note that `inside()` is primarily designed for script style programming.
If a user is working with an RScript, the previous code can be declared
“inside the multiverse object” using the `inside()` function as follows:

``` r
# here we just create the variable `df` in the multiverse

    mutate( ComputedCycleLength = StartDateofLastPeriod - StartDateofPeriodBeforeLast )
  
  df <- df %>%
    mutate( NextMenstrualOnset = branch(menstrual_calculation, 
      "mc_option1" ~ StartDateofLastPeriod + ComputedCycleLength,
      "mc_option2" ~ StartDateofLastPeriod + ReportedCycleLength,
      "mc_option3" ~ StartDateNext)
    )
})
```

In the rest of this vignette, we will use **multiverse code blocks** to
specify the multiverse. Please refer to the vignette
(`vignette("multiverse-in-rmd")`) for more details on **declaring
multiverse analyses in RScripts and RMarkdown**

### Declaring alternative analyses

Coming back to the analysis, the next step is to define our possible
alternate analysis paths. The `multiverse` package includes functions
that aim to make it easy to multiplex over these alternative analysis
steps and write multiverse analyses. We do this by enabling analysts to
declare code using syntax which is as close to that of a single universe
analysis as possible.

Consider these first few lines from the transformation code in the
single analysis above:

``` r
df <- df_durante %>%
  mutate(ComputedCycleLength = StartDateofLastPeriod - StartDateofPeriodBeforeLast) %>%
  mutate(NextMenstrualOnset = StartDateofLastPeriod + ComputedCycleLength)
```

But `NextMenstrualOnset` could be calculated in at least two other
reasonable ways:

-   `NextMenstrualOnset = StartDateofLastPeriod + ReportedCycleLength`
-   `NextMenstrualOnset = StartDateNext`

To create a multiverse that includes these three possible processing
options, we can use the `branch()` function. The `branch()` function
accepts three or more arguments. The first argument defines a
*parameter* (here `menstrual_calculation`) which is used as an
identifier for the decision point. The subsequent arguments define the
different *options* that the parameter can take which can optionally be
named. Each option defines the different choices that a researcher can
make at that decision point of their analysis. Here, the researcher
declares three ways of computing the variable `NextMenstrualOnset`. Each
option can be named (here, `"mc_option1"`, `"mc_option2"`,
`"mc_option3"`); however, names can be omitted. We strongly recommend
naming the branches with meaningful names to help the user keep track of
choices. If omitted, the entire syntax for performing that operation
will be treated as the name for that particular option.

    ```{multiverse parameter_options, inside = M}
    # here, we perform two `mutate` operations in the multiverse.
    # although they could have been chained, this illustrates 
    # how multiple variables can be declared together using the `{}`
    df <- df_durante %>%
      mutate( ComputedCycleLength = StartDateofLastPeriod - StartDateofPeriodBeforeLast ) %>%
      mutate( NextMenstrualOnset = branch(menstrual_calculation, 
        "mc_option1" ~ StartDateofLastPeriod + ComputedCycleLength,
        "mc_option2" ~ StartDateofLastPeriod + ReportedCycleLength,
        "mc_option3" ~ StartDateNext)
      )
    ```

More details on the `branch()` function can be found in the
corresponding `vignette(branch)`.

## The multiverse, with declared code and branches

Once you add the code to the multiverse, it automatically parses the
code to identify the `parameters` and the corresponding `options` that
have been defined for each parameter.

Once the code has been added, the `multiverse` object will have the
following attributes:

1.  `parameters`, which is a list of parameters

``` r
parameters(M)
#> $menstrual_calculation
#> $menstrual_calculation[[1]]
#> [1] "mc_option1"
#> 
#> $menstrual_calculation[[2]]
#> [1] "mc_option2"
#> 
#> $menstrual_calculation[[3]]
#> [1] "mc_option3"
```

2.  `conditions`, which is a list of conditions (we’ll define this
    later)
3.  `expand`, which is a tibble consisting of all possible combination
    of values for the multiverse

``` r
expand(M) %>% select(-.code)
```

<div class="kable-table">

| .universe | menstrual\_calculation | .parameter\_assignment | .results                            |
|----------:|:-----------------------|:-----------------------|:------------------------------------|
|         1 | mc\_option1            | mc\_option1            | &lt;environment: 0x7fc6ea5de108&gt; |
|         2 | mc\_option2            | mc\_option2            | &lt;environment: 0x7fc6ea61a7e0&gt; |
|         3 | mc\_option3            | mc\_option3            | &lt;environment: 0x7fc6ea63c868&gt; |

</div>

4.  `code`, which is the code that the user passes to the multiverse to
    conduct a multiverse analysis. However, we do not execute this code
    and it is stored unevaluated. The user can interactively edit and
    rewrite this code, and can execute it for the current analysis or
    the entire multiverse using dedicated functions.

``` r
code(M)
#> $parameter_options
#> {
#>     df <- df_durante %>% mutate(ComputedCycleLength = StartDateofLastPeriod - 
#>         StartDateofPeriodBeforeLast) %>% mutate(NextMenstrualOnset = branch(menstrual_calculation, 
#>         "mc_option1" ~ StartDateofLastPeriod + ComputedCycleLength, 
#>         "mc_option2" ~ StartDateofLastPeriod + ReportedCycleLength, 
#>         "mc_option3" ~ StartDateNext))
#> }
```

## Running a single analysis from the multiverse

At this point, we have defined three possible processing options (three
universes) in our multiverse. Keeping consistency with the interactive
programming interface of RStudio, we also execute the default analysis
in each step. In the previous step, we stored the results in the
variable `df`. We can see the result of the default analysis in the
multiverse by accessing the data frame from the multiverse object as
shown:

``` r
M$df %>% head()
```

## A multiverse with all possible combinations specified

Besides calculating the onset of the next menstruation cycle, there are
other variables which have multiple valid and reasonable processing
options. According to Steegen et al., these include defining
`Relationship` and `Fertility`, and exclusion criteria based on the
values for cycle length and certainty of responses. The next code chunk
illustrates how this can be added to the multiverse object defined
above.

    ```{multiverse default-m-2 inside = M}
    df <- df %>%
        mutate(Relationship = branch( relationship_status, 
          "rs_option1" ~ factor(ifelse(Relationship==1 | Relationship==2, 'Single', 'Relationship')),
          "rs_option2" ~ factor(ifelse(Relationship==1, 'Single', 'Relationship')),
          "rs_option3" ~ factor(ifelse(Relationship==1, 'Single', ifelse(Relationship==3 | Relationship==4, 'Relationship', NA))) )
        ) %>%
        mutate(
          CycleDay = 28 - (NextMenstrualOnset - DateTesting),
          CycleDay = ifelse(CycleDay > 1 & CycleDay < 28, CycleDay, ifelse(CycleDay < 1, 1, 28))
        ) %>%
        filter( branch(cycle_length, 
          "cl_option1" ~ TRUE,
          "cl_option2" ~ ComputedCycleLength > 25 & ComputedCycleLength < 35,
          "cl_option3" ~ ReportedCycleLength > 25 & ReportedCycleLength < 35
        )) %>%
        filter( branch(certainty,
            "cer_option1" ~ TRUE,
            "cer_option2" ~ Sure1 > 6 | Sure2 > 6
        )) %>%
        mutate( Fertility = branch( fertile,
            "fer_option1" ~ factor( ifelse(CycleDay >= 7 & CycleDay <= 14, "high", ifelse(CycleDay >= 17 & CycleDay <= 25, "low", "medium")) ),
            "fer_option2" ~ factor( ifelse(CycleDay >= 6 & CycleDay <= 14, "high", ifelse(CycleDay >= 17 & CycleDay <= 27, "low", "medium")) ),
            "fer_option3" ~ factor( ifelse(CycleDay >= 9 & CycleDay <= 17, "high", ifelse(CycleDay >= 18 & CycleDay <= 25, "low", "medium")) ),
            "fer_option4" ~ factor( ifelse(CycleDay >= 8 & CycleDay <= 14, "high", "low") ),
            "fer_option5" ~ factor( ifelse(CycleDay >= 8 & CycleDay <= 17, "high", "low") )
        ))
    })
    ```

Since the multiverse object has already been created and the one
parameter has already been defined, this will simply add to the previous
code:

``` r
code(M)
#> $parameter_options
#> {
#>     df <- df_durante %>% mutate(ComputedCycleLength = StartDateofLastPeriod - 
#>         StartDateofPeriodBeforeLast) %>% mutate(NextMenstrualOnset = branch(menstrual_calculation, 
#>         "mc_option1" ~ StartDateofLastPeriod + ComputedCycleLength, 
#>         "mc_option2" ~ StartDateofLastPeriod + ReportedCycleLength, 
#>         "mc_option3" ~ StartDateNext))
#> }
#> 
#> $`default-m-2`
#> {
#>     df <- df %>% mutate(RelationshipStatus = branch(relationship_status, 
#>         "rs_option1" ~ factor(ifelse(Relationship == 1 | Relationship == 
#>             2, "Single", "Relationship")), "rs_option2" ~ factor(ifelse(Relationship == 
#>             1, "Single", "Relationship")), "rs_option3" ~ factor(ifelse(Relationship == 
#>             1, "Single", ifelse(Relationship == 3 | Relationship == 
#>             4, "Relationship", NA))))) %>% mutate(CycleDay = 28 - 
#>         (NextMenstrualOnset - DateTesting), CycleDay = ifelse(CycleDay > 
#>         1 & CycleDay < 28, CycleDay, ifelse(CycleDay < 1, 1, 
#>         28))) %>% filter(branch(cycle_length, "cl_option1" ~ 
#>         TRUE, "cl_option2" ~ ComputedCycleLength > 25 & ComputedCycleLength < 
#>         35, "cl_option3" ~ ReportedCycleLength > 25 & ReportedCycleLength < 
#>         35)) %>% filter(branch(certainty, "cer_option1" ~ TRUE, 
#>         "cer_option2" ~ Sure1 > 6 | Sure2 > 6)) %>% mutate(Fertility = branch(fertile, 
#>         "fer_option1" ~ factor(ifelse(CycleDay >= 7 & CycleDay <= 
#>             14, "high", ifelse(CycleDay >= 17 & CycleDay <= 25, 
#>             "low", "medium"))), "fer_option2" ~ factor(ifelse(CycleDay >= 
#>             6 & CycleDay <= 14, "high", ifelse(CycleDay >= 17 & 
#>             CycleDay <= 27, "low", "medium"))), "fer_option3" ~ 
#>             factor(ifelse(CycleDay >= 9 & CycleDay <= 17, "high", 
#>                 ifelse(CycleDay >= 18 & CycleDay <= 25, "low", 
#>                   "medium"))), "fer_option4" ~ factor(ifelse(CycleDay >= 
#>             8 & CycleDay <= 14, "high", "low")), "fer_option5" ~ 
#>             factor(ifelse(CycleDay >= 8 & CycleDay <= 17, "high", 
#>                 "low"))))
#> }
```

The `expand` function will contain all the possible combinations of the
parameter options that have been identified.

``` r
expand(M) %>%
  select(-.code) %>%
  head()
```

In our multiverse we have identified 5 options for calculating
`fertility`, 3 options for calculating `menstrual calculation` and
`relationship status` each, 3 wyas of excluding participants based on
their `cycle length` and 2 ways of excluding participants based on the
self-reported `certainty` of their responses.

This results in $ 5 = 270$ possible combinations.

``` r
expand(M) %>% nrow()
#> [1] 270
```

We can then inspect the default analysis the default single universe
analysis from this multiverse:

## Specifying conditions in the multiverse analysis

In our example, we are excluding participants based on their *cycle
length*. This can be done in two ways: we can use the values of the
variable,`ComputedCycleLength` or `ReportedCycleLength`. If we are using
`ComputedCycleLength` to exclude participants, this means that we should
not calculate the variable `NextMenstrualOnset` (date for the onset of
the next menstrual cycle) using the `ReportedCycleLength` value.
Similarly, if we are using `ReportedCycleLength` to exclude participants
it is inconsistent to calculate `NextMenstrualOnset` using
`ComputedCycleLength`. In a multiverse analysis, it may occur that the
value of one variable might depend on the value of another variable
defined previously.

We should be able to express these conditions in the multiverse. We show
how this can be done, as well as other details on `conditions`, in the
corresponding `vignette(conditions)`.

## Modeling

Steegen et al. define a multiverse which only considers the various data
processing parameters, which we have defined above. To analyse the data,
they create 6 models. The first model uses data from example \#1. The
other five models use the data from example \#2, which we’ve using so
far.

### Model \#2: Effect of Fertility and Relationship status on Religiosity

The authors compute a composite score of Religiosity by calculating the
average of the three Religiosity items.

    ```{multiverse default-m-4, inside = M}
    df <- df %>%
      mutate( RelComp = round((Rel1 + Rel2 + Rel3)/3, 2))
    ```

The authors perform an ANOVA to study the effect of *Fertility*,
*Relationship* and their interaction term, on the composite Religiosity
score. We fit the linear model using the call:
`lm( RelComp ~ Fertility * RelationshipStatus, data = df )` inside our
multiverse and save the result to a variable called `fit_RelComp`.

    ```{multiverse default-m-5, inside = M, echo = FALSE}
    fit_RelComp <- lm( RelComp ~ Fertility * RelationshipStatus, data = df )
    ```

To extract the results from the analysis, we first create a tidy
data-frame of the results of the model, using `broom::tidy`.

    ```{multiverse default-m-6, inside = M}
    summary_RelComp <- fit_RelComp %>% 
        broom::tidy( conf.int = TRUE )
    ```

Recall that declaring a variable in the multiverse only executes it in
the default universe, and hence we need to call `execute_multiverse()`
to execute our analysis in each multiverse.

``` r
execute_multiverse(M)
```

Now that we have performed the analysis in each universe of the
multiverse, we need to plot the data. To plot the data, we need to
extract the relevant result data-frame from each universe into a single
data-frame. The following code does this, by extracting the variable
where the estimates of the model are stored, `summary_RelComp` and
creating a single tidy data-frame that can be accessed easily.

``` r
expand(M) %>%
  select(-.code) %>%
  mutate( summary = map(.results, "summary_RelComp" ) ) %>%
  unnest( cols = c(summary) ) %>%
  head( 10 )
```

We then take this data frame and plot the results as a confidence
interval and point estimate using `ggplot2`. As you can see, this is
similar to how you would plot a point estimate and confidence intervals
for a regular analysis. We then use `gganimate` to animate through the
results of each universe to quickly get an overview of the robustness of
the results.

Note: we discuss extracting results from the multiverse and visualizing
them in more detail in `vignette(visualising-multiverse)`

``` r
p <- expand(M) %>%
  mutate( summary = map(.results, "summary_RelComp") ) %>%
  unnest( cols = c(summary) ) %>%
  mutate( term = recode( term, 
                 "RelationshipStatusSingle" = "Single",
                 "Fertilitylow:RelationshipStatusSingle" = "Single:Fertility_low"
  ) ) %>%
  filter( term != "(Intercept)" ) %>%
  ggplot() + 
  geom_vline( xintercept = 0,  colour = '#979797' ) +
  geom_point( aes(x = estimate, y = term)) +
  geom_errorbarh( aes(xmin = conf.low, xmax = conf.high, y = term), height = 0) +
  transition_manual( .universe )

animate(p, nframes = 210, fps = 2)
```

## Conclusion

The authors also perform a number of other analysis using the same
independent variables (`Fertility`, `Relationship Status` and their
interaction term), but with different dependent variables:
`Fiscal political attitudes`, `Social political attitudes`,
`Voting preferences` and `Donation preferences`, which we omit here.
